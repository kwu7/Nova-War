# **Nova-War** 
## Project Description (explain the what/why/how)
### What
A 2D space shooter with different heros to choose from to fight many different aliens. The shooter will be able to move left and right via arrow keys and will be able to shoot lazers/projectiles via spacebar, dealing a various amount of damage depending on the character.
### Why
We grew up playing video games and thought that this would be a good homage to our childhood.
### How
Using Scene Builder and JavaFX, we will develop the GUI and take key inputs and button inputs. Finally, we will use Slick2D for graphics and animations.
