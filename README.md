# **Nova-War** 
## Project Description (explain the what/why/how)
### What
A 2D multiplayer space shooter in which you have to kill your opponent to win. Player1 will move with AWSD and Player2 will move with Arrow Keys. Both ships are automatically firing.
### Why
We realized that multiplayer battle royale and player vs player games are very popular. Also, we grew up playing video games and thought that this would be a good homage to our childhood.
### How
We used Slick2D, a Java game development library, to render images and shapes, initialize objects, and update everything including the mouse position. play button, ships, and shots.
## Deliverables (what you are going to deliver at the end of the semester)
