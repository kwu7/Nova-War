# **Nova-War** 
## Project Description (explain the what/why/how)
### What
A 2D space shooter to fight many different aliens. The shooter will be able to move left and right via mouse and will be able to shoot projectiles constantly dealing damage to enemies. Enemies will also shoot  so that you have to also dodge shots.
### Why
We grew up playing video games and thought that this would be a good homage to our childhood.
### How
Using Scene Builder and JavaFX, we will develop the GUI and take key inputs and button inputs. Finally, we will use Slick2D for graphics and animations.
